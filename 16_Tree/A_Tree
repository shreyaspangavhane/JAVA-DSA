tree data structure is a hierarchical structure


Binary tree: In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it.

Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”, “mid” and “right”.

** Basic Operation Of Tree Data Structure:

1. Create – create a tree in the data structure.

2. Insert − Inserts data in a tree.

3. Search − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is present or not.

4. Traversal:
    1. Preorder Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order manner in the data structure.

    2. In order Traversal – perform Traveling a tree in an in-order manner.
    3. Post-order Traversal –perform Traveling a tree in a post-order manner.
