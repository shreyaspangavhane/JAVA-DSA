sorting ==>> Sort the element in there asscending order;

types=>> 
       1) Bubble sort--> 
              compare the adjecent element
              comparision(passes) =n-1 passes
              Time Complexity= O(n^2)

       2) Insertion sort --> 
              Assume the first element is always sorted and to compare to next element and divide array into two parts sorted and unsorted.

       3) Selection sort-->>
              Assume 1st element is smallest then compare to adjcent :
                     i) if Number is large compare to adjcent then swap directly to that index.
                     ii) if Number is not large then again compare to their correspoendes adjcent element.

       4) Merge sort -->>(directlyivide and Conqure)
              divide the array util it will one element in that array then start compare.

       5) Quick Sort-->> (Pivot & Partition)
