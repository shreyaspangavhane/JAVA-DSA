//Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package.

/**
How Does LinkedList work Internally?
Since a LinkedList acts as a dynamic array and we do not have to specify the size while creating it, the size of the list automatically increases when we dynamically add and remove items. And also, the elements are not stored in a continuous fashion.
