BST:
    A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which 
    the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value and 
    the right child has a value greater than the node’s value. 

    This property is called the BST property and it makes it possible to efficiently
    search, insert, and delete elements in the tree.
